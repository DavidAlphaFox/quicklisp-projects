tar, cpio, etc reading library
ARCHIVE is a package for reading and writing disk-based file archives such as those generated by the 'tar' and 'cpio' programs on Unix.  This package aspires to be a pure Common Lisp replacement for the 'tar' program.

Current functionality includes basic extraction from and creation of tar archives.  Basic extraction from certain kinds of cpio archives is also supported.
