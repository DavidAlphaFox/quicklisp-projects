Compatibility layer for some Franz Allegro CL APIs (threads, sockets, ++)
ACL-COMPAT is a free set of compatibility layers for parts of Franz's ACL API for several Lisp systems. It provides ACL-like interfaces for:

* threads (including run- and arrest-reasons)
* Sockets? (including chunked transfer encoding on some implementations)
* Parts of the EXCL package
* Parts of ACL's SYS package
* ACL's NET.URI (networking) stuff

It is maintained together with Portableaserve, the portable implementation of Franz' AllegroServe Webserver, but can be installed without Portableaserve.
