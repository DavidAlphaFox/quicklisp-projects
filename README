quicklisp-projects has metadata for Common Lisp projects tracked by
Quicklisp. Each subdirectory is named after a project, and a project's
subdirectory has a source.txt file describing how to get the project's
files. Other metadata files will be added in the future.

The qlc-meta directory is special, and has files related to creating
and updating Quicklisp data.
