interface with copy protection dongles
CL-DONGLE is a Common Lisp library which provides full access to all the functionality of SG-Lock's hardware-based copy protection system, i.e. you can use it to protect your Lisp applications natively using features like storing Lisp objects in the dongle or encrypting and signing arbitrary data.
The library also contains a fast Lisp implementation of the Tiny Encryption Algorithm which works independently of attached dongles or the SG-Lock DLL and might thus be useful on its own.
