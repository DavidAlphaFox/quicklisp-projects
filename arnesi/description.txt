utility collection
Arnesi is a Common Lisp utility suite. It contains various "bits 'n pieces" of code which were useful while developing other code.

Features:
* flow control macros - while, whichever, if-bind, etc.
* a simple logging facility - kind-of/sort-of/maybe like log4j.
* http/html utilities - url and html escaping
* pattern matching - fare-matcher style pattern matcher and "regular" list matcher
* accumulation - collecting and reducing macros
* cps transformer - an ad-hoc, bug ridden implementation of half of call/cc.
* decimal arithmetic - convert floats to exact rationals and vice versa with a given precision; standard rounding functions.
* MOP compatibility package - The MOPP package provides the MOP's symbols on various implementations. Currently OpenMCL, CMUCL, SBCL, Lispworks and CLISP are supported.
